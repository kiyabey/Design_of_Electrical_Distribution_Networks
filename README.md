# Design of Electrical Distribution Networks
A Python tool for simulating and optimizing electrical distribution networks. This tool specifically handles N-1 contingency analysis, line loading, and voltage problems. 
It uses the **Pandapower** library to model and analyze the electrical distribution systems.

## Features
- Supports different network configurations (JSON- Pickle - Excel)
- Simulates electrical distribution networks
- Calculates line loadings - voltages and optimizes network configurations
